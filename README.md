# WFIH
Wine Fusion installer helper
Ths installer is aiming to make Fusion360 install under wine easier.
It is intended not being bundled with installer to avoid potential legal issues with autodesk. 

# How to:
- install wine, winetricks, uncompyle6, p7zip, mono, gecko
- uncompyle can be installed also via 'sudo pip install uncompyle6'
- download original fusion installer and place it into folder where you want to unpack and prepare it.
